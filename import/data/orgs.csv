In partnership with the City of New York and the community, the Prospect Park Alliance restores, develops, and operates Prospect Park for the enjoyment of all by caring for the natural environment, preserving historic design, and serving the public through facilities and programs.

The Alliance was formed in 1987 to restore the Park after years of budget cuts and a steady deterioration of both its natural areas and usage. By supplementing the Park's basic operating budget with private funds, the Alliance has initiated a large array of capital projects and community programs. The Alliance has boosted public awareness of the crucial role parks play in the urban environment, while gaining support from donors and volunteers for the restoration projects that have brought Prospect Park back to prominence.

The Alliance has not only been active in the restoration of Prospect Park's physical well-being, but also its transformation into an important cultural institution. It was instrumental in the restoration of the 1912 Carousel, the transformation of Lefferts Historic House into the first children's historic house museum in the United States, the renovation of the Park's playgrounds, and the capital campaign to save Brooklyn's only forest - a restoration of 150 acres of ailing woodlands in the Park's Ravine. The Alliance formed a trailblazing partnership with the National Audubon Society that resulted in the nation's first urban Audubon Center, which opened in 2002 at the Park's historic Boathouse. Recent successful projects include the renovation of Bailey Fountain in Grand Army Plaza, the complete reconstruction of the 40-acre Parade Ground, and a brand new Tennis Center. The planning process is now underway to replace the Park's beloved Wollman Rink with a new Lakeside Center.

The Alliance's efforts combined with the support of many business partners, private donors, and Alliance members, have increased use of the Park by 300*%, while making critical improvements to its fragile ecosystem and preserving its historic and architectural treasures.%,%%,2,1081287240,1178862360XYXXY127,%Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE)%,%The mission at PACE is to provide high quality educational and residential programs for individuals with autism and related disabilities, so they may experience learning, self care, productive work and positive interpersonal and community experiences.

<br>
Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited, progressively degenerative brain disorder that results in a loss of both mental faculties and physical control.  Symptoms usually appear in an individual between 30-50 years of age and progress over a 10-25 year period.  HD affects the individualâ€™s ability to think, speak and walk.  Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications.  Presently, there is no effective treatment or cure.  Although medications can relieve some symptoms in certain individuals, research has yet to find a means of conquering or even slowing the deadly progression of HD.  HDSAâ€™s continued investment in both clinical and basic HD research each year has brought about breakthroughs in potential treatment.  With your help a cure will be forthcoming.%,%http://www.hdsa.org/%,2,1090154280,1130907600XYXXY158,%Marin Conservation Corps%,%%,%%,1,1090379160,0XYXXY159,%Berkeley Parks Recreation & Waterfront%,%%,%http://www.cityofberkeley.info/marina/marinaexp%,1,1090712520,1094808420XYXXY160,%San Francisco Parks Trust%,%San Francisco Parks Trust is dedicated to providing leadership and support for San Francisco parks, recreation centers and open spaces.%,%www.sfparkstrust.org%,1,1090894680,1124313600XYXXY161,%Glide%,%The Free Meals Program - which is the largest of Glide's programs - utilizes one commercial-grade kitchen, two dining rooms, and tens of thousands of volunteers.

The Harlem School of the Arts (HSA), founded in 1964 by the nationally acclaimed soprano Dorothy Maynor, held its first classes in the basement of St. James Presbyterian Church, located at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and 141st Street. First piano, then Suzuki violin, drama, art and dance were taught to neighborhood children who had no other such place to develop musical and artistic talents. Miss Maynor believed that any child exposed to a full range of organized arts activities and instruction would grow up emotionally and intellectually richer. She also believed that commitment to and involvement in the child's studies of the arts would strengthen the family.
<br><br>
Today, in the modern, award-winning facilities, designed by Ulrich Franzen, and located adjacent to St. James Church, this philosophy continues under the leadership of, Camille Giraud Akeju President and C.E.O.
<br><br>
HSA helps young people find ways to use their energies in creative, goal-oriented ways. The school offers classical and jazz music training in instruments and voice; instruction in ballet, modern, ethnic, jazz and tap dance; classes in theater arts and creative writing; and studies in the visual arts, including sculpture and photography. Its faculty of arts professionals maintains high conservatory standards. Most faculty members are practicing artists, providing HSA students with truly professional role models.
<br><br>
The Harlem School of the Arts is one of the few institutions in the nation that offers comprehensive pre-professional and post-secondary arts training primarily to African-American and Latino students. Top quality programs are provided at a fraction of the cost of similar institutions, thus allowing students from economically disadvantaged families to attend. No one is ever turned away for lack of money.
<br><br>
HSA's year-round programs serve approximately 3000 young people and adults annually. While HSA is clearly a beacon in the Hamilton Heights community in Central Harlem, students come from all over the greater New York metropolitan and tri-state areas. They come to learn, to express, to fulfill creative dreams and discover themselves in and through the arts. Music, dance, theater, and the visual arts provide exciting ways for students of all ages to increase self-awareness and sensitivity to the world around them, to test the waters of their own originality, and to develop the self-discipline required to carry an endeavor through to completion.

City Harvest, a non-profit organization founded in 1982, is the world's first food rescue program.

Millions of pounds of good, edible food are thrown away each year by New York City food businesses. At the same time, more than one million people are hungry, one third of them children. City Harvest is the link between those who have so much and those who have too little.

This year, City Harvest will rescue over 19 million pounds of excess food from all segments of the food industry - including restaurants, manufacturers, wholesalers, greenmarkets, hotels, corporate cafeterias, grocery stores and farms - and deliver it to more than 500 agencies throughout the five boroughs using a fleet of 15 trucks and volunteers on foot. Each week, City Harvest helps over 260,000 hungry New Yorkers find their next meal.

City Harvest exists to end hunger in communities throughout New York City. We do this through food rescue and distribution, education, and other practical, innovative solutions.%,%http://www.cityharvest.org%,2,1146174480,1159419540XYXXY397,%Edgewater Community Council%,%Edgewater Community Council is a multi-service, nonprofit organization, with programs like Home Repairs for the Elderly, Immigrant Outreach, Community Policing/Safety Initiatives, Care for Real (one of Chicago's oldest independent food pantries), and the Youth Arts Program.

Charted by Congress 140 years ago, WHS established the city’s first public housing facility for stray and unwanted animals.  A year later, WHS pioneered the creation of the District’s first ever animal cruelty law and for a period of time in the late 1800s, WHS also was given the power to investigate cases of child abuse.

Throughout the years, the organization has helped spearhead new legislation to protect the animals that live in the nation’s capital. In the 1960s and 70s, WHS helped DC create laws to prevent animal hoarding, and better health standards for pet shops and medical research clinics.   

In 2001, after years of upholding and enforcing District animal cruelty laws, WHS was successful in its campaign to make animal cruelty a felony level crime.  Just months after the law was enacted, a man was convicted of felony animal cruelty in Washington, DC and was put behind bars for two years for stabbing and killing his pet dog. 

WHS operates two shelter locations; the private shelter at 7319 Georgia Avenue, as well as the District of Columbia Animal Care and Control Facility (under contract by the Department of Health) at 1201 New York Avenue.  In addition to the two animal shelters, WHS operates a low-cost, high-volume spay and neuter facility.

of Greater Indianapolis.
At Habitat for Humanity of Greater Indianapolis we are on a journey having completed 352 homes since 1987, but our journey is far from over. Few communities are untouched by poverty housing and homelessness, and in Indianapolis we are no different. At Habitat for Humanity of Greater Indianapolis, we do build homes, but the more important thing we build is hope. Those in our community with resources-time, money, skills or products to share are joined with local families who desperately need a simple, decent, affordable place to call home, where they can be a part of our community. 

Volunteers get the satisfaction of helping someone who needs it, learning new skills, and improving the community in which they live. Future homeowners get a hand-up, this is not a hand-out! Families are required to complete hundreds of hours of sweat equity and pay a no-interest no profit mortgage.  Habitat for Humanity of Greater Indianapolis at its most basic level is neighbors helping neighbors. 

We have been successful in building 352 homes with families in need in our community; for one reason because local people care-people just like you, for that we are eternally grateful. 

We invite you to join us as partners on this beautiful journey of not only building homes but hope. Not only more homes, but the more fulfilled lives those homes will afford. And not only better lives but a better Indianapolis.

OUR VISION

Our vision is to be an internationally recognized student-oriented, service and social entrepreneurship website used by millions of junior, middle, high school and university students around the country, enabling students to find their passion while making a difference in the lives of millions in their communities and around the globe.


  


INSPIRED 2 IMPACT! provides students an online resource to become engaged in service and social entrepreneurship by connecting them to one another and non-profits across the country. Students with INSPIRED 2 IMPACT! are able to share videos promoting the non-profits they work with, participate in student-driven discussion in groups focusing on a variety of causes, and communicate directly with mentors who can provide beneficial advice. They also have access to online courses, award and scholarship opportunities, and so much more.

INSPIRED 2 IMPACT! also provides a unique solution for students to track their volunteer hours. This helps them to meet school service requirements and build a service resume for scholarships as well as college and job applications. Schools can track their students' service hours to ensure their students meet the school requirements and non-profits can monitor volunteer hours to help in their grant writing and fundraising efforts.
%,%www.inspired2impact.org%,10,1280929152,1280929219XYXXY1200,%Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault%,%The Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault (INCASA) believes that sexual assault is a violent crime of power and domination that can be perpetrated against all persons, and that the healing of victims cannot be separated from the healing of society. INCASA is part of that society, and it recognizes that it must continually reassess its own attitudes and consciousness.

INCASA views itself as an organization working toward the elimination of sexual assault and realizes that its most important goal must be to achieve its own non-existence.

INCASA exists to provide education, advocacy, and support to professionals, communities, and survivors regarding sexual violence in Indiana.

In April 1986, thirty people from throughout Indiana gathered in Indianapolis to address the needs of victims of rape statewide and to network with other service providers by sharing experiences, knowledge and resources. That first meeting, initiated by Sex Offense Services, South Bend, became the impetus for INCASA. Later meetings produced goals, by-laws, membership requirements, dues, and in 1987, the Coalition incorporated. INCASA is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization in good standing with the Secretary of State.

The effort grew quickly & was adopted as a project by the entire Rotary District 5030 (Puget Sound Region).  Based in Seattle, RFH has 28 years of experience in surplus produce procurement, collection and distribution. RFH actively solicits donations of surplus fruits and vegetables directly from farmers and processors. Then, we solicit trucking companies to donate or significantly discount "deadhead" space (trucks coming back empty from a delivery) to deliver the food from the donor to our partner food bank distribution warehouses in Washington: Food Lifeline, Northwest Harvest, Emergency Food Network (Tacoma) and Second Harvest Inland Northwest (Spokane). RFH is the only organization of its kind in the state of Washington.

The goal of RFH is to reduce hunger‐related malnutrition by ensuring that individuals and families who visit food banks or hot meal programs have the fruits and vegetables they need to provide a healthy, well‐balanced diet. We do this by providing millions of pounds of produce directly to hunger‐relief systems, by engaging Rotarians, growers, trucking companies and others in hunger response work and by serving as a facilitator and developer for programs that ultimately provide additional food and resources to those who are served by hunger‐relief programs statewide.

(Probably not — but how about an older dog with less energy, maybe one who has lived with an elderly person and knows that lifestyle?) Are two cats better than one? (Absolutely — they’ll likely be playmates and keep each other company.) Why won’t my cat use her litterbox? (Ask for our handout of litterbox lore!)

Need to locate a vet, a pet-sitter or a groomer? We can help! Think your dog could benefit from some training classes? We’ll help direct you to a reward-based trainer closest to you.

reTails is a work in progress, so you’ll be hearing a lot more about us. We’re developing and expanding our network of resources for pet owners and planning our first permanent reTails location. Our stores will be in neighborhood shopping areas where you can come in at your convenience to get information about life with your pet, buy pet products, get help to solve pet problems, get immediate assistance if your pet becomes lost, visit animals available for adoption, and take home a new best friend!

%,%www.retailsindy.org%,10,1284820863,1284820863XYXXY1225,%JWPOSD%,%The Jean Weingarten Peninsula Oral School for the Deaf (JWPOSD) was founded in
1969 by eight families seeking an educational program which would teach their deaf
and hard of hearing children to listen and speak, therefore enabling them to become
independent and self -sufficient citizens. Those first families became JWPOSD’s initial
Board of Directors. Over the past 40 years, JWPOSD has expanded to serve the entire
Bay Area and works with the youngest of deaf children through first grade, with an
outreach branch in Sacramento. It is the mission of the school to teach children who are
deaf or hard of hearing to listen, and talk with a view to attaining mainstream education.

Research shows that the first 1,800 days (5 years) of a child’s life are the most important
for the development of speech, language, cognitive, social skills and confidence that
are important for future success, in school and in their lives. For deaf children who are
learning to listen and talk, these days are critical. Emerging data are showing that over
90*% of children who are implanted with cochlear implants before the age of two and with
expert auditory instruction, attain intelligible speech. JWPOSD offers day classes and
individual speech therapy sessions to deaf children regardless of their parent’s ability to
pay for such services.

JWPOSD goals are to: transition each child into regular classes in local schools with
excellent academic and social abilities by or before first grade; and to transform the lives
of these children and their families through training, education, audiology support, and
parent education.%,%%,11,1284954917,1284954917XYXXY1226,%Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Assoc.%,%DebRA of America was founded over 30 years ago.

Founded in New York City in 1997, Dress for Success is an international not-for-profit organization offering services designed to help our clients find jobs and remain employed. Each Dress for Success client receives one suit when she has a job interview and can return for a second suit or separates when she finds work. 

Since 1997, Dress for Success has served more than 550,000 women around the world. Each year we reach more than 50,000 women in the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands, Mexico, Poland and the West Indies. All Dress for Success organizations are not-for-profit entities, with Dress for Success Worldwide and its U.S. affiliates having 501(c)(3) charitable status and those outside the U.S. operating as registered charities. Clothing donations and financial contributions made to Dress for Success affiliates within the U.S. are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

Dress for Success serves clients by referral only, and women must have an interview scheduled before receiving clothing. Our clients come to us from a continually expanding and diverse group of non-profit and government agencies including homeless shelters, immigration services, job training programs, educational institutions and domestic violence shelters, among many other organizations. More than 3,000 organizations throughout the world send women to Dress for Success for professional apparel and career development services. 

On her initial visit a woman receives a suit appropriate for the industry in which she is interviewing and, if available, accessories. After a woman finds a job she returns to Dress for Success for additional clothing that can be mixed and matched to make several outfits, providing her with the foundation for a professional wardrobe. 

While we may be best known for providing suits to women, it is our employment retention programs that are the cornerstone of the organization. Soon after Dress for Success was founded we came to recognize that finding work is only one step in a woman's journey towards economic independence; remaining employed and building a rewarding career are essential if a woman is to become self-sufficient. 

To meet the need for services that would help women both find and keep jobs, we established the Professional Women's Group (PWG) program, which offers women ongoing support as they successfully transition into the workforce, build thriving careers and prosper in the mainstream workplace. Once a woman joins the PWG she is a member for life, able to attend meetings at any affiliate throughout the world, and can benefit from additional employment retention and mentoring programs. 

Dress for Success also has developed Career Center, an initiative that promotes confidence and professionalism by providing women career guidance, the chance to acquire technology skills and assistance in their job searches. 

Another way in which Dress for Success supports women joining or returning to the workforce is through Steps to Success, an initiative that focuses on the crucial first 30 days of employment, during which newly-hired women face many potential challenges. Made possible by the generosity of the National Endowment for Financial Education, the Steps to Success: A Guide to Success in the Workplace publication helps women prepare for their new jobs, identifies barriers they might encounter during their first days, encourages them to plan for their futures and highlights resources that can assist them during this transition, including the Professional Women's Group. 

Dress for Success relies on the financial contributions, in-kind donations and volunteer efforts of individuals and companies around the world who are committed to helping women take charge of their lives.

Care for Real was established in 1970 by members Father Bill Johnson of the Epsicopal Church of the Atonement, Rabbi Herman Schaalman of Emanuel Congregation and other members of the Edgewater Clerical Rabbinical Association. This organization, which is now know as the Edgewater Community Religious Association (ECRA), wanted to provide emergency help to victims of fires in "Arson Alley," the Kenmore-Winthrop corridor between Foster and Devon. It was intended to be a short-term solution to a specific problem. However, it soon became clear that there was a need in Edgewater for an ongoing safety net for neighbors in need. Today Care for Real is the safety net for the entire Edgewater community.

Over the years, the organization has expanded its services, always with the aim of preventing and relieving suffering.

Today, in addition to domestic disaster relief, the American Red Cross offers compassionate services in five other areas: community services that help the needy; support and comfort for military members and their families; the collection, processing and distribution of lifesaving blood and blood products; educational programs that promote health and safety; and international relief and development programs.

The American Red Cross is where people mobilize to help their neighbors—across the street, across the country, and across the world—in emergencies. Each year, in communities large and small, victims of some 70,000 disasters turn to neighbors familiar and new—the more than half a million volunteers and 35,000 employees of the Red Cross. Through nearly 700 locally supported chapters, more than 15 million people gain the skills they need to prepare for and respond to emergencies in their homes, communities and world.

Some four million people give blood—the gift of life—through the Red Cross, making it the largest supplier of blood and blood products in the United States. And the Red Cross helps thousands of U.S. service members separated from their families by military duty stay connected. As part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, a global network of 186 national societies, the Red Cross helps restore hope and dignity to the world's most vulnerable people.

An average of 91 cents of every dollar the Red Cross spends is invested in humanitarian services and programs. The Red Cross is not a government agency; it relies on donations of time, money, and blood to do its work.

The American National Red Cross is headquartered in Washington, Gail J. McGovern is President and CEO, and Bonnie McElveen-Hunter is Chairman of the Board of Governors.

 In 2005, Emily E. Perry joined the Indianapolis Institute for Families as a Clinical Associate and Director of Special Programs. At that time, the Indianapolis Institute for Families had provided the Child Abuse Treatment Program to Hendricks County for over 20 years. Shortly after joining the Institute’s team, Emily identified an opportunity within Hendricks County that had the potential to systematically improve the county’s ability to investigate allegations of child abuse while maintaining the child as the first priority…a Child Advocacy Center.

After over 2 years of talking about the development of a Child Advocacy Center, little to no progress was being made. In December, 2007 Emily coordinated an informational meeting to introduce the concept of a Child Advocacy Center to Hendricks County. Representatives from virtually every law enforcement jurisdiction in Hendricks County, the Hendricks County Prosecutors Office, the Hendricks County Department of Child Services, Hendricks Regional Health, and the Indianapolis Institute for Families attended this informational meeting. From that information meeting, a Child Advocacy Center Steering Committee was developed. 

Through the support and dedication of a number of individuals that participated on the Steering Committee, Susie's Place celebrated its Grand Opening in April, 2009! Since that time, well over 100 child forensic interviews have been conducted at Susie's Place. Susie's Place has been utilized by 13 different law enforcement agencies and seven (7) county Department of Child Services offices. Additionally, Susie's Place has coordinated cases with four (4) other states. Susie's Place is committed to strengthening the community's ability to nurture and protect children.

The Oaks Academy is a Christ-centered school that exists to provide a rich, classical education to children of diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, preparing them to succeed in a rigorous secondary educational program and to demonstrate spiritual, social and emotional maturity.



Our Vision
The Oaks Academy began as a response to the academic needs of a desperate neighborhood. Now into our second decade, The Oaks remains true to our mission and celebrates the evidence that students and families are thriving in our midst.

We have established a strong neighborhood school in an urban setting that also appeals to those from other areas of town who desire a unique experience for their children. From the beginning we have championed a student population that is 50*% low income/poverty level; 25*% middle income; and 25*% upper income. In this way we have been able to bring people together, increase graduation rates, and — we believe — bring social change to our city.

The area takes its name from the style of houses built here between 1870 and 1900. Early residents built modest frame cottage in a variety of styles, including shotgun and Queen Anne vernacular. Many of the cottages feature turned posts and spindles, gingerbread trim porches, brackets, and fishscale shingles.

The one architectural exception is the brick residence at 711 Dorman St., built for Frederick Ruskaup in 1892. Undoubtedly the gem of the neighborhood, this brick mansion stands out among the cluster of small frame cottages. Ruskaup, a German native, immigrated to the United States in 1869. Older neighborhood residents recalled that in the early 1870s he wanted to build his grocery and house in the newly formed Woodruff Place, but because that neighborhood was restricted to houses, he decided to build on the other side of the United States Arsenal (now Arsenal Technical High School). By 1875 he had constructed a two-story brick grocery at 717-19 Dorman St., where his family lived in an upstairs apartment. In 1885 he added on to his grocery store. In 1891 he hired Vonnegut & Bohn, young Indianapolis architects, to design his brick home at 711 Dorman St., as well as to rebuild his five rental doubles across the street.

Many of the 19th-century residents of Cottage Home were German. A significant number of Irish and a smaller group of African-American families also lived in the area, which remained a working class neighborhood well into the 20th century. The nearby railroad provided employment, as did veneer and furniture factories on Dorman St., and a flour mill on Highland Ave. From the teens through the 1930s, many residents worked as trolley operators for the Highland Car Barns (now St. Clair Press) on the corner of Highland Ave. and St. Clair St. Others worked as carpenters, machinists, policemen, firemen, factory workers, and tradesmen.

Like many downtown neighborhoods, the area suffered a decline from the 1940s through the 1980s. Residents watched as dozens of homes were demolished for the highway a couple blocks west. The threat of the Highland-Dorman connector (a plan to widen the streets, now removed from the city planners' books) and talk of making the area an industrial park did not give residents incentive to continue investing the their properties.

In the mid-1980s, the 150-home community experienced a restoration boom. Cottage Home Neighborhood Association was formed in 1984 and remains as one of the city's most active neighborhood groups. Projects through the years have included:

•moving houses to save them from demolition
•educating residents about restoration
•purchasing vacant lots
•hosting the Cottage Home Block Party
•conducting oral histories with long-term residents
•changing the zoning from industrial to residential
•crime watch and neighborhood clean-ups
•bi-monthly meetings
•and much more

Early Learning Communities

The majority of development occurs before a child enters school, which means he or she must be exposed to educational opportunities from birth. In fact, studies have shown that children who can’t read by the first grade will spend their lifetimes catching up.

Early Learning Communities [ELCs] provide caregivers with the tools and training needed to ensure that the children they care for start school prepared and ready to learn. ELCs are facilitated by neighborhood organizations partnered with United Way, allowing caregivers to receive training and resources that are convenient and personalized to their needs. The ELC Incentive Program enables caregivers to earn points for participating in ELC events that can be redeemed for gift cards or professional development opportunities to help advance their childcare skills.

In addition to United Way, the following individuals and organizations are partners in the ELC effort: Congressman Sander Levin, High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, The Great Start Collaboratives, The Kresge Foundation, The Max M. & Marjorie Fisher Foundation, NCAA and The Skillman Foundation.

Art Shanty Projects is an artist driven temporary community exploring the ways in which the relatively unregulated public space of the frozen lake can be used as a new and challenging artistic environment to expand notions of what art can be.
Artistic Goals

The project provides a unique opportunity for artists to interact with their audience, and vice versa, in an un-intimidating, non-gallery like environment. Artists can choose to work in a way that directly engages the audience i.e. knitting or singing Karaoke or in a more passive way.

The focus of this project is on both process and quality of artistic product:

    Artists creating projects that push them and engage the audience.
    The project management providing a flexible structure to work, allowing for the development and realization of an artist’s idea.
    The project must self-govern to respect the environment of the lake and the community of fisher-people and neighbors that already exists, we are bringing a new use to a place that already has an established relationship with its patrons.
    Audience engagement is essential to the success of the experience, for both artist and audience.

The project runs for 4 weekends. Staffing your project during the weekends, and focusing interaction with the audience during these times is encouraged, and should be addressed in your proposal.
Values

We value respect for the frozen lake community of which we are a part.
We value respect for the environment.
We value artists’ work and strive to pay them a fair wage.
We expand the definition of who is an artist.
We value the importance of artist and community interaction.

Preeclampsia and related disorders such as HELLP syndrome and eclampsia are most often characterized by a rapid rise in blood pressure that can lead to seizure, stroke, multiple organ failure and death of the mother and/or baby.

The Preeclampsia Foundation is an empowered community of patients and experts, with a diverse array of resources and support to help you have the best possible pregnancy or to help you navigate the questions you’ll have if you don’t. We provide unparalleled support and advocacy for the people whose lives have been or will be affected by the condition – mothers, babies, fathers and their families.

We are steadfast in our resolve to improve diagnosis, management and prevention of preeclampsia through research and improved health care practices.

In the meantime, because all pregnancies are at risk, our best defense against the worst outcomes is to ensure patients understand and appropriately respond to the warning signs of preeclampsia. The problem is, few people are aware and adequately informed.

With your help, we can drive awareness, advance our scientific understanding and medical practices, and together help create a world where preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy no longer threaten the lives of mothers and babies.%,%%,11,1327696671,1327696671XYXXY1527,%Playworks Detroit%,%The Playworks Mission: To improve the health and well-being of children by increasing opportunities for physical activity and safe, meaningful play.

"It was a bitter cold day during the Winter Carnival," says Bob Gallivan. Some of his pals stopped by to get out of the cold and have a drink. "Let’s have a Saint Patrick’s Day Parade," Gallivan remembers saying, "before we get too old."

Word spread and the planning began. Judge Edward Devitt who had marched every year –"It’s a sin to miss it"—was part of that first committee. "This is a natural center for a St. Patrick’s Day parade, because there are so many Irish."

All of the parades have been a rousing success. Even that first one, whipped into shape in just two months, drew crowds six deep on the side walks. The marchers, lead by Mayor Thomas Byrne, carrying a shillelagh, left the Hilton hotel (now the Radision) at noon and proceeded down Kellogg Blvd. to the St. Paul Hotel. The last unit crossed the finish line at 12:40.

Tucked in among the family units and the dignitaries were the Brian Boru Irish pipe band, the St. Patrick honor guard, even the Vulcans, who wrapped their fire truck in green crepe paper for the occasion.

But the focus of the parade has always been on the family groups. According to Stewart Loper, Treasurer of the Saint Patrick’s Association which sponsors the parade activities, the sentiment is that we want the families and kids to participate." Loper calls it "a baby buggy parade. And we work hard to keep it that way."

As a result, motorized vehicles are kept to a minimum. There’s a float for Ms. Shamrock and a car for the celebrity Grand Marshal. Over the years that has included such notables as film star Pat O’Brian, entertainers Dennis Day and Carmel Quinn, hockey coach Herb Brooks, and Joe Feeney from "the Lawrence Welk Show."

The tradition of the crowning a local Irish lass Ms. Shamrock began with that first parade – Agnes Sullivan was the lucky lady. William J. Hickey was the first Mr. Pat, an honor extended to the man of Irish descent who as contributed the most to life in St. Paul.

There are other traditions initiated in 1967 that remain part of the festivities – the swath of emerald paint down the center of the parade route, for instance. And the six weeks of button blitzing that the Miss Shamrocks and the Blarney Brothers perform to raise money for the parade and charities.

SAC's gallery is located in Boston's Back Bay in the gallery district on Newbury Street. The gallery occupies two floors, with a retail gallery on the first floor and an exhibition gallery on the second. Boston's only dedicated craft exhibition space features four exhibitions annually.

To fulfill our mission, SAC sponsors exhibitions, the Artist Awards Programs, and educational programming. We also promote the work of over 400 craft artists in both our galleries on an ongoing basis.


Background and History

The term "arts and crafts" was coined in England in the late nineteenth century and used to describe a growing movement designed to revive the decorative arts. Led by figures like William Morris (1834-1896), the English poet, artist, craftsman, designer, social reformer and printer - the Arts and Crafts Movement had at its core the idea of handmade objects that were both beautiful and useful in everyday life. By the mid-nineteenth century, cheap factory-made goods had almost entirely driven handcraftsmen and women from their trades. The old methods of making handsome, everyday objects by hand, developed and passed down over the centuries, were nearly lost.


The Arts and Crafts Movement proved to be enormously influential, popular and long-lasting, spreading widely on both sides of the Atlantic. Boston's close relations to England, and its role as a cultural and educational center, made it the perfect place for the ideals of the English Arts and Crafts Movement to take root and spread.

Meeting in Boston in the spring of 1897, a small group of architects, educators, craftspeople, and collectors organized the first crafts exhibition to be held in this country. The work of more than 100 craft artists was featured. The success of this first exhibition provoked the organization of The Society of Arts and Crafts, its purpose being "to develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts.%,%http://www.societyofcrafts.org%,15,1330869339,1330869339XYXXY1545,%Midwest Food Bank%,%Food Bank%,%%,10,1330881885,1330881885XYXXY1546,%BAGLY%,%BAGLY: The Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth, is a youth led, adult supported social support organization, committed to social justice, and creating, sustaining and advocating for programs, policies and services for the LGBTQ youth community. 

In July of 1980, long before the days of community, political or financial support, BAGLY was founded by LGBTQ youth who believed that an organization led by and for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning youth would be central to meeting the core physical, social and developmental needs of Greater Boston’s LGBTQ youth community. Turns out they were right!  Three generations of queer youth movement leaders later, BAGLY is recognized nationally for its pioneering role in creating, sustaining and advocating for social support, leadership development and health promotion programs for LGBTQ youth.  BAGLY’s approach and historic practice, which has served over 30,000 youth, is replicated by programs and organizations across the country and our earliest programs (Including our Youth Speakers Bureau, youth led HIV/AIDS education and the nation’s first prom for LGBTQ youth) have provided a foundation upon which many youth-led programs and organizations are built.

Throughout its history BAGLY has advocated and provided leadership for an LGBTQ community driven statewide and national systems approach to working with LGBTQ youth.  As a founding organization of the National Youth Advocacy Coalition and the Massachusetts Governor’s Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth, and by establishing the GLBT Youth Group Network of Massachusetts, our vision and innovation has led the way in building a stable local and national infrastructure vital to today’s LGBTQ youth work.

Today, BAGLY provides community-based leadership development, health promotion and social support programs for Massachusetts LGBTQ youth communities, and is a leader in local and national LGBTQ youth advocacy work and workforce development.

Best Buddies programs engage participants in each of the 50 United States, and in 50 countries around the world.  Best Buddies’ seven formal programs – Best Buddies Middle Schools, High Schools, Colleges, Citizens, e-Buddies, Jobs and Ambassadors – positively impact nearly 700,000 individuals with and without disabilities worldwide.

The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) is the leading national not-for-profit organization exclusively dedicated to understanding and preventing suicide through research, education and advocacy, and to reaching out to people with mental disorders and those impacted by suicide.

To fully achieve its mission, AFSP engages in the following Five Core Strategies:

Fund scientific research
Offer educational programs for professionals
Educate the public about mood disorders and suicide prevention
Promote policies and legislation that impact suicide and prevention
Provide programs and resources for survivors of suicide loss and people at risk, and involves them in the work of the Foundation
History
In 1987, a number of leading experts on suicide came together with business and community leaders and survivors of suicide to form AFSP, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. They believed that only a combined effort would make it possible to fund the research necessary for progress in the prevention of suicide. Such an approach has proven successful with heart disease, cancer and diabetes and it was hoped that it would be successful in dealing with depression and suicide.

Many of our original founders were concerned with the alarming rise in youth suicide over the past four decades. During this period, the suicide of young men had tripled; that of young women had doubled. Suicide is now the second major cause of death among high school and college students.

Suicide is even more frequent among older people. The highest rates are found in men over 50. Before the AFSP was formed, there was no national not-for-profit organization dedicated to funding the research, education and treatment programs necessary to prevent suicide. Over the past 20 years, we have changed that.%,%http://www.afsp.org%,15,1336566893,1336566893XYXXY1590,%Cambridge Arts Council%,%The Cambridge Arts Council (CAC) is the official arts agency for the City of Cambridge, MA.

History of the Center
The William Way Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center was formed in 1996, when a group of community leaders came together with the goal of creating a stronger, more stable community center out of Penguin Place, the community center at the time.

After an extensive search, the Community Center purchased the former Engineers' Club of Philadelphia in March 1997. Soon after, renovations began, and the building opened to the public in July 1997. Since then, the Center has developed an array of programming and services that target LGBT groups, and community organizations have moved permanent offices into the Community Center. In addition, over 70 groups meet at the Community Center on a regular basis, and many more use the facility for special events. The building is open seven days a week and is currently used by over 2,500 people each month.
  Who was William Way?
Known as simply "Bill" to many in the community, he was loved for his compassion, courage and generosity of spirit. He was an openly gay man at a time when coming out of the closet often had severe consequences.

Bill Way was a longtime city employee who, working with the Redevelopment Authority and the Office of Housing and Community Development, over saw the construction of affordable housing throughout the city, including Washington Square West, where he lived.

He was also an advocate for our community, and a strong proponent of creating change by bringing people together. Bill played a key role in the establishment of Penguin Place, our predecessor. Even as his life came to an abrupt end due to AIDS, he continued to spend many hours working on the first AIDS walk and Penguin Place.

Way's life was about two ideas: building the city and strengthening the city. How appropriate it seems then that his name graces this building, an architectural gem we are bringing back to life in the growing heart of our community. %,%http://waygay.org/%,16,1345384765,1345384765XYXXY1658,%American Cancer Society%,%The American Cancer Society is a nationwide, community-based voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.

Designed for children and families, Museum exhibits focus on science, culture, environmental awareness, health & fitness, and the arts. In addition to extensive child-centered exhibits, Museum educators develop numerous programs and activities that address literacy, performing arts, science and math, visual arts, cultures, and health and wellness.

His love of scuba diving and the 30 fish tanks he kept in his bedroom growing up is evidence of this.  And four years ago he decided it was time to turn his passions into a business.
 
In 2006, he began his eco-entrepreneurial journey by starting a company that sold a line of sustainable jewelry that donated a percentage of profits to ocean conservation initiatives. And for a while, it was going quite swimmingly.
 
But after a few years, Brian couldn’t pinpoint any concrete environmental benefit of his monetary donations. How could he be sure that his company’s money was actually contributing to real and significant ocean conservation efforts?  And more importantly, how could he call himself a real supporter of the blue movement without getting his hands dirty?
 
With those realizations, Brian founded United By Blue in May of 2010.  This company would be different. It would not give money away, but instead associate the sale of each product with a concrete environmental action. For every product sold, UBB removes one pound of trash from oceans and waterways through company organized and hosted cleanups.
 
Not only does the UBB business model enable us to be the catalyst for real conservation efforts, it also allows us to develop a fun, engaging, and community-focused brand.  Our cleanups are the bedrock of our company, and allow us to engage with thousands of volunteers and inspire participation in the blue movement.
 
On the apparel side of things, UBB is inspired by Brian’s own explorations growing up abroad and by that moment of discovering something forgotten.  The colors of our products are inspired by weathered buildings in harbor towns, and we like to tell stories of Hidden Gems to introduce people to forgotten beauty around the world.
 
After all, the Blue Movement is all about rediscovering and restoring one of the greatest Hidden Gems of all: our oceans.%,%%,16,1363216038,1363216038XYXXY1777,%Daniel Webster Elementary School%,%Daniel Webster Elementary School is a public school located in Potrero Hill with 270 students.

What makes this street fair a uniquely San Francisco event is the broader cultural context participants can experience in addition to traditional Asian-Pacific influences. The Nihonmachi Street Fair organizers have a long history of including local entertainment that have spanned genres from Taiko to hip-hop to salsa, rock, and jazz.
 
The Nihonmachi Street Fair proudly evolves to reflect the city it celebrates while staying true to its original mission: to use this community event as a platform to mentor Asian-Pacific American youth and foster their leadership and communication skills through volunteerism and community service.
 
The event is produced, staffed, and organized by youth volunteers, thus providing practical, hands-on experience in collaboration, entrepreneurship, and problem solving.

The California Historical Society is a membership-based, non-profit organization with a mission to inspire and empower people to make California's richly diverse past a meaningful part of their contemporary lives.

BRIEF HISTORY
In June 1871 a group of people assembled at 323 California Street, marking the first of four attempts to begin the California Historical Society (CHS). After the undocumented collapse of the first group, a second attempt to revive CHS lasted from 1886 to1891. In 1902 the ailing Society partnered with the California Genealogical Society and for a brief period the collaboration prospered. The earthquake and fire damage of 1906 induced yet another break of CHS.

Finally in 1922 C. Templeton Crocker, grandson of Charles Crocker, permanently resurrected the Society. Also that year, Crocker placed at CHS his fine collection of Californiana, rivaling those of Hubert Howe Bancroft and Henry E. Huntington. His financial generosity supported CHS until the dues collected enabled the organization to hire its first staff member in March 1923. The group held its first exhibition at the Bohemian Club in San Francisco in 1924.

CHS's initial purpose was the publication of a quarterly journal, which it has produced since 1922. Two decades later, Crocker permanently donated his collection to CHS, which still continues to form the foundation of the North Baker Research Library and the Fine Arts collection today. For a short time CHS shared its headquarters with the Society of California Pioneers. However, in 1956 the Society established its own home in the Whittier Mansion, at the corner of Jackson and Laguna, in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.

In October 1993 the Society purchased 678 Mission Street, home of the former San Francisco Builders Exchange, E.M. Hundley hardware store, and Nancy Pelosi's first campaign headquarters in the re-developing Yerba Buena Gardens neighborhood. The building was renovated for seismic safety and the basement, which extends underneath the Mission Street sidewalk, was converted into climate-controlled storage vaults for much of the Society's collections. The North Baker Research Library finally found a home worthy of its importance as a free and open portal to the vast and growing CHS collection.

In 2012, a modest but meaningful interior remodel opened up the Mission Street-facing spaces and brought in award-winning Heyday books into itsbook store and community gathering space. Also, the exterior received new layers of paint-in Sherwin Williams' International Orange, the color of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge-to welcome a stunning exhibition CHS mounted as its part in celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the famous rust-colored suspension bridge.

The mission: to turn four bare walls into a clean, dignified and welcoming home by repurposing gently used household goods. The vision of two Birmingham women, Ana Smith and Treger Strasberg, Humble Design was born out of their belief that decent families emerging from homelessness deserve to come home each day to a clean, friendly, and dignified home. All family members would have more time, effort and resources to focus on education, home life, employment and building a better future.Humble Design partners with local area homeless and abuse shelters to identify families that are emerging from shelters and into low-income housing. Many of these families are victims of abuse and have left behind all personal items upon escaping and entering an emergency shelter. Most have no beds, books, toys or furniture to call their own. Once a partnering agency makes a referral, Humble Design volunteers meet with the families to do a needs assessment and develop a client wish list. From there, Humble Design volunteers move swiftly to: assemble the furnishings, toys, accessories and housewares; do any minor cleaning; and, officially move the families into their new housing.The end result is something like an extreme makeover on-a-dime. Humble designers are very adept at creating safe, comfortable and welcoming homes with a total per-home budget of only $500-$1,500 including the value of all furnishings and in-kind services. The Humble families are overwhelmed by the generosity and support received from the Humble designers. The designers are truly fulfilled by giving of their time and talents to help others in need.%,%http://humbledesign.org/%,14,1391131923,1391131923XYXXY1924,%Save Our Streets Boston %,%Founded in 2008,  the goal of Save Our Streets - Boston  is to guide and support those within the community in following their dreams, and by doing so, promote the positive development of the Boston community as a whole.
