It works toward that goal by distributing food and advocating for improvement in government food programs and policies.  <br><br>A nationwide network of food suppliers allows the food bank to turn each dollar donated into $9 of nonperishable groceries, fresh produce, bread and meat for the community.  <br><br>An affiliate of Feeding America (formerly America's Second Harvest) - the nation's food bank network - the San Francisco Food Bank supplies food to more than 600 community food programs ranging from senior centers and after-school programs to soup kitchens. The food bank reaches tens of thousands of individuals each month. This year, the food bank will distribute 33 million pounds of food, which is enough to provide more than 70,000 meals to hungry San Franciscans every day.%,%%,1,0,1390866836XYXXY2,%San Francisco Rec & Park Dept - Natural Areas%,%%,%%,1,0,1300820688XYXXY4,%San Francisco Rec & Park Dept.%,%%,%%,1,0,1300820526XYXXY5,%Friends of Baxter Creek%,%Formed in 1997, Friends of Baxter Creek is a nonprofit affiliate of the Urban Creeks Council dedicated to:
