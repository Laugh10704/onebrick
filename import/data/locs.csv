Metro bus routes 43 and 48 run near the Arboretum. Ask for the McGraw street stop. If you are coming from Madison Street, you can take route 11, get off at Lake Washington Boulevard East, and walk north into the Arboretum. Several buses coming from the eastside stop at the end of SR-520. Not sure which one you need? Use Metro's Trip Planner to get here.
Arboretum Drive East, one of two main roads inside the Arboretum, is bike-friendly. Cyclists often use Lake Washington Boulevard, but be aware that traffic volume can be high and lanes are narrow. 
You can reach Arboretum Drive East from the University District by crossing the Montlake Bridge and following signs for MOHAI and the Arboretum.

Take the Bay Bridge (US 80 East) to the University Avenue Exit in Berkeley

Follow University Avenue toward Berkeley through the first signal, Sixth Street (.2 miles). Do not make a U-Turn at Sixth, it is not allowed, and you can be ticketed.

·        Make a U-turn at the first place where it is legal (7th Street, just past the first signal). When taking the University Avenue Exit in Berkeley, beware that at 6th Street (the first light) it is illegal to make a U-Turn. You must go one block further to 7th to avoid a traffic ticket.

After the U-turn, follow University Avenue over the freeway to the four-way stop (.5 miles)
Go straight through the four-way stop and stay on University Avenue into the Marina (.3 miles)
At the fork in the road, bear right onto Marina Blvd
Follow Marina past the hotel to the north side of the marina (.4 miles)
The road will turn 90 degrees to the left. You are now on Spinnaker Way
Follow Spinnaker Way (.2 miles) until you see the Berkeley Marine Center and the sign for OCSC on your left
Turn into the yard, drive through the rows of boats on cradles and you'll see our two story clubhouse on your right. Park only in designated areas.

The lot adjacent to the club is often full by 10am on weekends. The lot is generally reserved for members and staff but visitors are welcome to stop your cars in front of the building to unload occupants, and then park in one of the following areas:

1.      The closest (northern-most) row to Spinnaker Way in the lot adjacent to ours. Be careful not to park in the double-length spaces designated for vehicles towing boat trailers—you will be ticketed.
2.      Two lots over (east) from OCSC. This lot has ample spaces for cars and is only a three minute walk from OCSC.

OCSC asks that you please observe the fire lanes, and that you observe the five (5) mile per hour speed limit through the boat yard and in the parking areas. The area around OCSC is a working boat yard; a number of people are present in the yard working in and around their boats, making speeding an unnecessary hazard.%,%%,%%,%-122.3186500%,%37.8686880%,1281483719,1281483811,1XYXXY1949,%Yogurt Works%,%3074 El Camino Real%,%%,%Santa Clara%,%CA%,%95051%,%Tucked away in the T&H Camino Center (across the street from the American flag of Wheels & Deals) Yogurt Works is one of Santa Clara's best kept secrets, and well worth the discovery!
